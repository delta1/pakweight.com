Join us as we watch this legendary old rollerblading movie by Herman Potgieter!

We take a trip down the memory lane of early 2000s rollerblading with the crew from Johannesburg, South Africa.

Herman edited this with no computer, just two VCRs and some skate tapes.

In 2005 we digitized it and released it as part of a double DVD with our next release, Stereotype.

Featuring iconic spots from Joburg, Cape Town, and Europe, and some of the top B-Boy and Graffiti competition at the time.

Enjoy this with us as we watch it again, 20 years later.
