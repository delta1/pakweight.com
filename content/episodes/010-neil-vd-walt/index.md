Our guest is Neil van der Walt, OG Pretoria rollerblader and photographer/film maker!

We chat about the early days of rollerblading in South Africa, skateparks, and making portable launch boxes.

Neil started skating at 9 years old, and was blown away by early skate videos like The Hoax and Mad Beef, memorizing every trick and song.

He found the Kyalami skatepark with some friends, and we talk about all the national skate comps, planning runs, and international skaters at the Alex Cup comp in Cape Town.

We go over some history and pictures of Neil skating at school, going on skate tours, taking photos on a film camera, the Cape Town skate scene, beef with Blunt Magazine, and Neil's horrific fall where he broke his hand and had to have surgery, and regaining his confidence in rollerblading after that!
