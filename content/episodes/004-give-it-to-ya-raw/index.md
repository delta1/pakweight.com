In this episode we're joined by Garrett Pieters AKA 24 Garrett Gold AKA Goonz. We discuss growing up skating and punking out in Rustenburg, fighting jocks, and going to the rollerblading world championship in Lausanne in 1998. We take a look at a bunch of great skating and partying pictures across the country, doubles runs at Kyalami/Roces skatepark, drinking in Durban and dropping mixtapes in Joburg.

We talk about the value of focus and perseverance, with which you can achieve anything if you don't give up!
