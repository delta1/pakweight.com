Our guest this episode is our legendary friend Clifford Viljoen. He tells us about growing up in Pretoria, becoming a pro skater for Roces international, and travelling the world skating competitions with the best of the best. We reminisce about the Kyalami Roces skatepark, epic best tricks battles, and street skating sessions with the homies. We also give thanks to Mel and Brent Tuson, Soloman, Chris van der Merwe, and all the friends we grew up rolling with.

Make sure to read Cliff's [Roll for Life blog](https://knucklehub.wordpress.com/familia/features/roll-for-life/), and follow him on Instagram [@cliffordviljoen](https://www.instagram.com/cliffordviljoen/).
