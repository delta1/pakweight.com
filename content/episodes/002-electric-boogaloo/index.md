Welcome back to The Pakweight Show!

In this episode we're joined by our friend Nic, and look at memories of growing up rollerblading all over South Africa.

We got an update from our friend Cliff on the origin of the Pakweight name, mentioning Alon's Corporation Of Rude Perverted Skaters (CORPS).

Memories of skating around Sandton and Rivonia. Night sessions, Gametronics, Mortal Kombat, and more.

We look at old SA nationals competition posters spanning 1999 to 2001, with nostalgia about the Kyalami skatepark, Mel and Brent Tuson, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town,
and the Fishbrain website.

We talk about rollerblading, kung fu, Wu-Tang, sunset sessions at Kyalami, and our dearly departed friend Gazza Cartwright and the Keep It Roll street comps in his name.
