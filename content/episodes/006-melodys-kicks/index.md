Melody Tuson joins us to discuss the early days of importing Roces skates, organizing competitions, and sponsoring the team. Melody and Brent were instrumental in the rollerblading and extreme sports scenes right from the early 90s. From inline hockey, to skateparks, stunt shows and parties, they were there right from day one.

Thank you Brent, Mel, Storm, and Patrick Tuson for all you've done!
