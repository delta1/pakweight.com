Welcome to the very first episode of The Pakweight Show!

JQ, Bizzle, and Frank introduce themselves, the show, and the origin of the Pakweight name.

We take a look at some old photos, growing up rollerblading in the early 90s, skateparks, pro bladers, competitions, and the tragic passing of our friend Alex Groll.

You can [download the slides here](slides.pdf), or view the images we talked about below.
