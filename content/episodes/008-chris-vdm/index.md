We made this very special episode when we were all together in person in Cape Town, with our legendary friend Chris Van Der Merwe. He talks to us about his history in blading, growing up in the Free State, playing rugby, moving to Pretoria and then Cape Town. We discuss his performance in the Alex Groll Cup park competitions, SA Nationals 2003, X-Games, and various street competitions, skating for Roll1, and giving his life to God. We go through some pictures of street skating, the trip to Dubai, and the Son Skate Nationals. We also chat about his skatepark in Somerset West, his work with Inspired 2 Become and the Christian Skaters Africa, teaching the youth to skate and giving back to the community.

Massive thanks to [Lino Skate Shop](https://linoskateshop.com/) for their generous donations and assistance with the comp at The Shred, and also a huge thank you to Peter Lambert for the audio video equipment and studio space!
