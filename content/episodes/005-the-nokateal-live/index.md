Our guest this episode is our good friend Matthew Dowdle, to chat about rollerblading history as the youngest Team Roces skater.

We look at old photos of skating Boogaloos, Sandton Street, and Kyalami skatepark amongst others. We discuss inspirational skaters like Arlo Eisenberg and Jon Bergeron, skating competitions, and shows with Team Roces. Great memories of our dearly departed friend Gazza Cartwright, his 18th birthday party and spraypainting a mural for him after his passing.
