Morgan AKA DJ Switch joins us to talk about his early days of rollerblading and becoming a DJ and breakdancer.

We chat about rollerblading, Kyalami, breakdancing, being inspired by DJ Reddy D to become a DJ, graffiti, trips to Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, Dubai, the X-Games, and all the crazy stories that happened along the way.
