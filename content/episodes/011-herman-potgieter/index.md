In this episode of, we welcome the OG blader himself Herman Potgieter aka HERMZ, a legendary figure in the South African rollerblading scene. Herman shares his rollerblading journey, starting from his early days ice skating at Friday night sessions before discovering rollerblades in the early 1990s when the sport exploded from California to South Africa. We cover his progression through various skate setups, from his first Jokaris with their plastic wheels, to the coveted Roces and Majestic skates that defined the aggressive skating era. Herman recounted his experiences at iconic spots like East Rand Mall and Boogaloos, where he mastered vert ramp skating before transitioning to become one of the most stylish street skaters in the scene.

We chat about the competitive landscape of South African rollerblading, with Herman reflecting on his podium finishes throughout the scene's golden era. He shared insights about meeting international pro skaters like Arlo, Rene, and Jess during competitions, which marked pivotal moments for the local skating community. The conversation touched on how competition formats evolved from structured runs to more session-style formats, and Herman's philosophy on always starting with a "banger" trick to set the energy for a successful run. Throughout the episode, Herman's passion for the sport and his role as an OG influencer in the South African rollerblading community shine through.
